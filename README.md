# ✈️ Landing Rate Analysis  

This project analyzes **Approach** and **Landing** performance from any given flight data telemetry containing multiple aircraft at once (real data, DCS, MSFS, etc.) to determine all **Final Approach** glideslopes, extract key touchdown/impact parameters, and generates visualizations of the landing approach and touchdown.

>**Disclaimer** The project is still under development. Some features may not be fully implemented yet.

## 🗽 Credits:
- Fardad Pouran, callsign "*< 404 > D1CE*".
- 404^th *Freelancers* Virtual Squadron DCS community.
- [Tacview](https://www.tacview.net): exports flight telemetry data.

⚠️ **Note**: The dataset included for exhibition is from a massive flight data flown by 404th community. Here, the dataset is filtered to only two pilots to reduce the file size.

## 🎯 Features
### 📉 Approach Analysis: 
-   Visualizes **final approach glideslope** for each aircraft. Each descent segment is rated by a color.
  - Also identifies if the aircraft bounces the touchdown!

### 🛬 Touchdown Criteria: 
- Extracts and plots key touchdown quantities: 

  | Quantity | Unit | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | **Vertical Speed** |  $\textit{{fpm}}$ | Vertical speed at touchdown |
  | **Vertical Acceleration** | $\textit{{fpm}}^2$ | Vertical impact-force/acceleration on aircraft CG|
  | **Jerk** | $\textit{{fpm}}^3$ | Sudden change of impact-force/acceleration on aircraft's CG |

### Landing Rating Table
- CSS styles landing table for each aircraft and each sortie.
- Exports `.csv` of the table.

## 🚧 To be added
- **Landing Rating Criteria**: Customizable criteria for rating the landing performance.
  - Impact **G-force**.
  - $\delta$: Landing gear stroke (the compression when the gear absorbs the impact).
  - **Impact Time**: Time interval when gears are compressed until stabilization.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly GUI for easy interaction with the analysis tools.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

- `Datasets/`: Raw CSV data.
- `Results/`:  Analysis results: Approach plots and landing rating CSV file.
- `Detailed Touchdowns/`: Contains detailed plots of each touchdown/impact.
- `Landing Rate.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook for the analysis.

## 🖥️ Installation
